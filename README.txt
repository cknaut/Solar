Solar System Simulator

Idea: Chose initial positions the planets of our solar system see how things evolve. 

Possible addition: Use Machine Learning to create stable conditions enabling benefitial goal such as life on earth, longest lifetime, blablabla

Timeline


A: Preparation

1. Engineer Physics Engine (Simple Hamiltonion mechanics model of gravity), output image of solar system at arbitrary time T
2. Port engine to Django App, run engine on server and output image in browser
3. Deploy
3. Create simple animation out of simulation results
4. Add customizing input (change size of planets, velocities etc.)

B: Machine Learning
