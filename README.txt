Solar System Simulator

Goal: Interactive Webapp integrating a gravitational N-Body problem and rendering nice animation results

Timeline

A: Preparation

1. Engineer Physics Engine (Simple Hamiltonion mechanics model of gravity), output image of solar system at arbitrary time T --> Completed 
2. Port engine to Django App, run engine on server and output image in browser --> Completed
3. Deploy
3. Create simple animation out of simulation results
4. Add customizing input (change size of planets, velocities etc.)

B: Machine Learning
TODO
