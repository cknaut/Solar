Solar System Simulator

Goal: Interactive Webapp integrating a gravitational N-Body problem and rendering nice animation results

Timeline

A: Preparation

1. Engineer Physics Engine (Simple Hamiltonion mechanics model of gravity), output image of solar system at arbitrary time T --> Completed 
2. Port engine to Django App, run engine on server and output image in browser --> Completed
3. Change Plotting from Matplotlib to chart.js or comparable, since matplotlib and heroku don't like each other
or
3. Reconsider deployment options
4. Deploy
5. Create simple animation out of simulation results
6. Add customizing input (change size of planets, velocities etc.)

B: Machine Learning
